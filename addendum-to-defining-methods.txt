further defining methods with optional arguments

if we want to have an option argument, we only need to assign it in the method definition like so:

def salad_spinner_ingredients(thing1 = “lettuce”, thing2, thing3)
	puts “I want a salad that has #{thing1}, #{thing2}, and #{thing3} in it”
end

in the above, if we only supplied two arguments, lettuce would be added as the default value for the thing1 variable.
