arrays

can be initialized with standard means

> new_array = []
=> []
> new_array_2 = Array.new
=> []

we can add new items to the end of an array with one of two methods, the “shovel” method or the push method

> new_array << “item we want”
=> [“item we want”]
> new_array.push(“salad”)
=> [“item we want”,”salad”]

to add to the front of the array

> new_array.unshift(“spiders”)
=> [“spiders”,”item we want”,”salad”]

to remove an item from end of array, we use the pop method which also returns the item we removed

> new_array.pop
=> “salad”
> new_array
=> [“spiders”,”item we want”]

to remove an item from the front of the array, we use the shift method

> new_array.shift
=> “spiders”
> new_array
=> [”item we want”]

indexes are referred to like elsewhere using square brackets; we can request the value of the array index like so

> new_array[0]
=> “item we want”

other array methods that might be useful

> new_array.count
=> 1
> new_array.reverse
=> [“item we want”]
> new_array.include?(“item we want”)
=> true
> new_array.include?(“Item we want”)
=> false
> new_array.push(“yay”)
=> [“item we want”,”yay”]
> new_array.unshift(“hurray”)
=> [“hurray”,”item we want”,”yay”]
> new_array.first
=> “hurray”
> new_array.last
= “yay”

we can request the index position of an item if we know it’s value

> new_array.index(“yay”)
=> 2

requesting the value of an index number that doesn’t exist returns nil

> new_array.index(“spiders”)
=> nil
