“truthy” or “falsey” are programming adjectives to describe the state of being true or false

in Ruby, only nil and false are falsey states, everything else is truthy

!true => false

a single bang operator (!) will negate the state of the object it is referencing

> something = nil
> !something 
=> true
> something = 1
> !something 
=> false

a double bang operator (!!) will return the truthiness state of the object it is referencing

> !!nil
=> false
> !!true
=> true
> !!”yeah!”
=> true

true and false have their own data types:
- every instance of true is an instance of the TrueClass
- every instance of false is an instance of FalseClass


Boolean logic operators include:

! is the NOT operator
&& is the AND operator
|| is the OR operator

Boolean Comparison operators include
== is the COMPARISON operator
!= is the negation of the COMPARISON operator
> is greater than
< is less than
>= is greater than or equal to
<= is less than or equal to

example of usage to control flow

> easter_eggs = 16
> ducklings = 3
> ducklings.class
=> Fixnum
> easter_eggs.class
=> Fixnum
> ducklings.class == easter_eggs.class
=> true
