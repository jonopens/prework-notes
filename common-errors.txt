Error anatomy

WHERE, WHY, WHO

NameError = undefined or invalid, like when we donâ€™t assign any value to a variable

SyntaxError = non-sensical code, does not follow rules/conventions

TypeError = Ruby encounters an object of an unexpected type (string + number)

ZeroDivisionError = self-explanatory

NoMethodError = calling a method not defined for a particular object; usually the result of a nil; also can be result of conflicting types (e.g. attempting to manipulate a string with fixnum methods)

nil = Python None Type

ArgumentError = too few or too many arguments provided
