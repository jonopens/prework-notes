Defining methods

def greeting # method signature
	puts “Hello World” # method body
end # method closing

method names must start with lowercase letters

Note: Programmers love conventions, or agreed upon rules that help them talk to each other about code. A common syntax convention for Ruby methods is to preface them with a #, and in subsequent lessons, you might see methods written with a # in front of the method name. For example, if a method is named 'greeting', rubyists will often refer to it as #greeting. This is so that other rubyists can instantly recognize it as a method, as opposed to a variable or a bareword or a class. But remember that when you write it in your code, it should be greeting and not #greeting.
