hashes

hashes are not indexed by number unlike arrays

to create hashes, we do it the same way we do it just like with arrays

hash = {}
hash = Hash.new

hash keys must be unique or else the overwrite the value of the key they reference

symbols are frequently used in hashes because they are immutable - they are always located at the same place in memory whereas two string variables with the same text will not have the same location in memory

> name1 = “Bob”
=> “Bob”
> name2 = “Bob”
=> “Bob”
> name1.object_id == name2.object_id
=> false

because of symbols are always the same location in memory, they use less when called and are more efficient.

for versions of Ruby of 1.9+, an alternative syntax was introduced that is equivalent to the hash-rocket

> {:dude => "swordfish"} == {dude: "swordfish"}
=> true

altering a hash through the []= method only returns the changed value, not the entire hash
