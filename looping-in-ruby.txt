looping in Ruby

here’s a simple looping program to PUTS a string 10x to terminal using the Fixnum.TIMES DO construction

10.times do 
    puts "Hi! Welcome to my very repetitive program"
end

interestingly, it returns the fixnum 10 - I’d like to know why that is. is it just confirming the total number of completed loops in case there’s an error?

a simple infinite loop script using the LOOP DO construction

loop do
  puts "I have found the Time Machine!"
end

like in Python, Ruby uses the BREAK keyword to stop looping if conditions are met; it “breaks” the loop cycle

like so many other languages, we can use a counter variable and increment with += to add to the counter variable

counter = 0 
loop do 
  counter += 1
  puts "Iteration #{counter} of the loop"
  if counter >= 10 
    break 
  end
end

Also, there’s a WHILE loop as with many other languages

counter = 0
while counter < 5
  puts “shut up”
  counter += 1
end

there is also an UNTIL loop that looks for equality

counter = 0
until counter == 5
  puts “shut up”
  counter += 1
end

there is also a FOR loop

for time in number_of_times
