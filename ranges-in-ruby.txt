In Ruby, a "range" is a set of values with a beginning and an end. A range can contain strings or integers.

A range of strings: ("a", "b", "c", "d")
A range of integers: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
â€˜
A range can be constructed using this notation: (100..200)
Or this notation: (100...200)

Using a .. ("double-dot") includes the second number (200) in the range, while using a ... ("triple-dot") excludes it.
