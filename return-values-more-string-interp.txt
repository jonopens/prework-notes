without the return keyword, the return value of a method in ruby is the return output of the last line of the code block

def salad
	weird = “hey delicious.”
	puts weird
end

the return value above is nil, so we should declare the return value

def salad
	weird = “hey delicious.”
	return weird
end


string interpolation

single quotes do not support string interpolation

OK: puts “something something #{name}.”
NOT OK: puts ‘something something #{name}.’
