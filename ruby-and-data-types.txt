Programs are generally composed of basically three things:
- keywords (reserved words)
- data (a string, an integer, a float, a Boolean, etc.)
- a bareword (a variable)

Anything that doesn’t adhere to those three things will cause an error

Six (6) data types in Ruby

- strings
- - methods
- - - .length & .size
- - - .upcase
- - - .downcase
- - - .reverse
- numbers
- - two number types
- - - fixnum (whole numbers)
- - - floats
- - methods
- - - .floor (low round)
- - - .round (nearest round)
- - - .ceil (high round)
- - - .next (increment by one whole number; only works on fixnum)
- booleans
- - for if/case statements
- - true/false
- symbols
- - denoted with : (:some-kind-of-thing)
- arrays
- - [“hello”,”world”)
— - methods
- - - .sort (order by value if numbers)
- hashes
- - key value pairs
- - {“danny” => “brooklyn”, “joe” => “new jersey”}

In Ruby, there are two ways to create data:

For Strings

literal constructor: 
“hello” => “hello”

class constructor: 
String.new(“hello”) => “hello”

For Arrays

literal constructor:
[1, 3, 400, 7]

class constructor:
Array.new => [] 

For Hashes

literal constructor: 
{“1” => “2”, “3” => “4”}

class constructor
Hash.new => {}
