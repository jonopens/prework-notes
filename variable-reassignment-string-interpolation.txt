variables

when you reference a variable that has since had its value reassigned, i.e.

toast = 1
bread = toast
toast = 2
puts bread would yield 1, not 2

pass by value vs. pass by reference

Ruby is “pass by value” in that it creates a copy of the reference to an object, thereby preserving the original value (even if reassignment occurs)

interpolation is pretty easy

salad = “goat cheese and watermelon salad”
puts “For lunch, I’d like a #{salad}, please.”
