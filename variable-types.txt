LOCAL VARIABLES only apply where they are declared - “If we define a variable within a method definition, only the method knows about that variable.”

from lecture notes:

def my_method
  local_variable = "Only my method knows about me!"
end
 
puts local_variable
=> NameError: undefined local variable or method `local_variable' for main:Object

GLOBAL VARIABLES can be accessed anywhere in a program and are declared with a dollar sign in front

$global_variable = “wtf, mate”

global variables should be used sparingly if at all - they break encapsulation and can make debugging difficult to accomplish.

CONSTANTS are either in ALL CAPS or Capitalized. Their scope is dependent on context - they are global when defined as such and local when defined within classes and modules. 

Constants cannot be defined within methods.
Constants should not be reassigned.
